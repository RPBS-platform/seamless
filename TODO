For a real 0.8 release:

- Re-run high-level tests once more
- Jobless: create generic run-transformation backend: Singularity + SLURM
- Update README documentation, indicate that OSX/MSYS2 should work, seamless-minimal, Conda is now niche.
- Basic example notebook / README.md . Add "edit cell over HTTP" section.
  Simple index.html for cell ctx.a with two buttons (get value, set value) and two fields. 
  Move section 3 and 4 to the end (de-emphasize)
  change validator "assert self.a < self.b" to "assert self.a + self.b < 100' 
- rerun non-automatic tests (lowlevel and highlevel)
- write example, e.g. a hhblits search where the database path is a DeepFolder
checksum.
- Jobless: test if a deepfolder folder name is transferred.

Post 0.8 (write in Github issues)

- Allow cells in a subcontext to be marked as "input" or "output".
A subcontext will not translate unless all "inputs" have been connected.
.status of the subcontext and all its members will reflect this.
- Allow "input"/"output" cells and all Transformer pins to have a "scatter" flag. Such cells or pins must be connected from DeepCell if "mixed", or DeepFolder if "bytes".
Any Subcontext with "scatter" flags get translated via a stdlib.map
construction. Transformer with "scatter" flags get upgraded to Subcontext. This makes stdlib.map an implicit part of the Seamless high-level language, essentially.
Alternatively, "input"/"output" cells and transformer pins that are 
*already* of the celltype DeepFolder/DeepCell/DeepListCell can have a "scatter_chunk" parameter, for map_dict_chunk evaluation. This does not
change the celltype of what they are connected to (the context/transformer will still operate on a deep dict/list, albeit a much smaller one). DONE: need then an API to get execution order (for incremental)!
Make sure that any scattered Subcontext/Transformer has no .mount or .share!
Also, modifying the value of a cell/pin CANNOT be relayed to the low level
(there are many low-level copies!) and a re-translation is necessary.
Tell this to the user when they make such a modification!
- Add a status redirection mechanism to catch error messages agnostic of the internal stdlib.map. NOT URGENT: SPIN OFF INTO GITHUB ISSUE.
- Do includables (https://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless/issues/119),
including finishing bootstrap.
- Documentation and checks of seamless-cli
