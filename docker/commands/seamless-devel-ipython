# Runs an IPython terminal  inside the Seamless Docker image
# - Current directory is mounted to /cwd, and the command is executed there
# - /tmp is mounted as well
# - Seamless has access to the Docker daemon, so it can launch its own Docker
#    containers via the Docker transformer. This works only under Linux.
#    NOTE: THIS IS A BIG SECURITY HOLE, IT CAN GIVE ROOT ACCESS TO YOUR SYSTEM
