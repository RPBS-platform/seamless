Seamless Zen
============

Cells are good, files are bad, URLs are ugly.

All state is in cells, unless it is local.

Always be prepared to rebuild from cells.

More than two numbers don't add up, nor do they multiply

Random generators cannot be random.

Execution takes as long as it has to.

Watch the state of now, don't watch the news.

Importing libraries is good, as long as they are external.

Structures hold, classes manipulate.

APIs and GUIs are good, unless they hide things away.

Edit all state, then edit the editor.

Transform lazily, react eagerly.
