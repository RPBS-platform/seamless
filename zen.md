Seamless Zen
============

Checksums are best.

Cells are good, files are bad, URLs are ugly.

All state is in cells, unless it is ephemeral.

Always be prepared to rebuild from cells.

History doesn't matter.

Random generators must not be random.

More than two floating numbers don't add up, nor do they multiply

Execution takes as long as it has to.

Errors can always happen, but wrong answers are unforgivable.

Importing libraries is good, as long as they are external.

Structures hold, schemas validate, classes manipulate.

APIs and GUIs are good, unless they hide things away.

Edit all state, then edit the editor.

Transform lazily, react eagerly.
