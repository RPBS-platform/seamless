Seamless Zen
============

Watch the state as it is now, don't watch the news.

All state is in cells, unless it is local.

Always be prepared to rebuild from cells.

Cells are good, files are bad.

Importing external libraries is good, importing project code is bad.

Namespaces are good, classes less so.

GUIs are good, unless they hide the state.

Edit all state, then edit the editor

Code execution is repeatable; if it is not repeatable, you throw away the code,
and keep its result.

Transform lazily, react eagerly.
