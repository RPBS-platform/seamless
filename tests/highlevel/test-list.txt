Non-automatic tests
=========================
add.py
simpler-share.py: Run with ipython -i, then do "curl localhost:5813/ctx/myresult".
                  IPython values printed should be 36 then 39 (Silk); curl should return 39
                  change ctx.a to get 3*a as the result
highlink-cpp.py:  Run with ipython -i, then continue in interactive mode,
                  changing the source code and the schema until it works.
mount.py:         Run with ipython -i, then continue in interactive mode.
                  Initial output is in test-outputs/mount.out
python-debugging: Run with ipython -i, then continue in interactive mode.
observe-graph.ipynb: Run "jupyter-seamless-devel" and then open /cwd in the browser
traitlets.ipynb: same as above
share-pdb.py: open with seamless-devel-ipython -i, Open in http://localhost:5813/ctx/index.html
visualize-graph/visualize-graph.py, Open in http://localhost:5813/ctx/index.html
share-pdb-docker.seamless/.zip: to test using:
      seamless-devel python3 /home/jovyan/seamless-scripts/serve-graph.py \
      share-pdb-docker.seamless share-pdb-docker.zip
    Open in http://localhost:5813/ctx/index.html
    (seamless-serve-graph does not work as it does not expose the Docker socket)
    Potentially, add:
      --status-graph /seamless/seamless/graphs/status-visualization.seamless \
      --add-zip /seamless/seamless/graphs/status-visualization.zip
    In that case, open also http://localhost:5813/status/index.html
