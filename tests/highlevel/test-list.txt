simpler-deepcell.py: As of Seamless 0.2, prints out double decref warnings at the end
simpler-ipython.py: Run with ipython --no-term-title (not -i). Output is approximate, depends on exact timings.

simple-pi-redis.py: requires redis to run as a Sink
simple-pi-remote.py: run with jobslave-noredis

Non-automatic tests
=========================
simpler-share.py: Run with ipython -i, then do "curl localhost:5813/ctx/myresult". 
                  IPython values printed should be 36 then 39 (Silk); curl should return 39
                  change ctx.a to get 3*a as the result
