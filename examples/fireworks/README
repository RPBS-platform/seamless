Original documentation:

Example demonstrating simulation of fireworks using point sprites.
(adapted from the "OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide")

This example demonstrates a series of explosions that last one second. The
visualization during the explosion is highly optimized using a Vertex Buffer
Object (VBO). After each explosion, vertex data for the next explosion are
calculated, such that each explosion is unique.
