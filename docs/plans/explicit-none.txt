Dealing properly with explicit None values
==========================================

Make it so that transformations and reactors CAN set None on their result
(Allow any worker inputpin to be annotated as must_be_defined=False.)
 Same for None explicitly set on cells (cell.set_value(None), or cell.set_none() by a graph;
  cell.set_void() explicitly sets a cell to void-None)
 Read accessors that retrieve None when reading their path (as opposed to AttributeError/KeyError)
  also are considered "explicit None".
 Transformations that resulted in an exception are NOT explicit None (they are "void-None").
 Explicit None values are NOT void and do NOT lead to void cancellation
 Explicit None values are allowed on input pins that have their support explicitly enabled.
