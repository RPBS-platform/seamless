Shell
=====
 
Create new namespace upon request/upon update; either pre-execution or post-execution [post-execution may re-execute transformer/macro]
The shell should be created and the connection info dumped in a JSON file, to be connected
See shell.py and quick-devel.txt (or the quick module) for proofs-of-principle.
This works with ipdb in jupyter console as well.
The Spyder IDE already supports variable browsing, it should eventually support breakpoints

Older thought
=============
some smart tool (based on pyshell) that can launch unit tests in a kernel,
tie a IPython instance to the kernel, and tie a editing window to the kernel for tab completion
(eventually, with breakpoints too).
