The stability of seamless.core tasks is not 100 %.
This shows mostly in:
- the traitlet value changed code (before the "timer handle" throttle)
- the bind status graph observer code in v0.5.1 and earlier, when every status/exception
update led to a modification using ctx2.status_.handle

The root cause is most likely the add_synctask hack in structured cell tasks,
 which is necessary because manager.structured_cell_trigger
 does not work well when called from tasks

For now, 0.5.2 seems to solve the acute stability problems, but on the long term,
 the problem should be fixed for real.
