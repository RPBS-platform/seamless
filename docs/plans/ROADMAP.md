Testing
=======
- Re-run low level tests (no problems expected)
- Run and adapt high-level tests (mostly DONE)
- Re-run initial examples, in particular BCsearch (DONE for final state; TODO for intermediate)
- Re-run capri example (on abathur)

MTiAutoDock
===========
Use Snakemake?
Adapt existing Mobyle HTML?
(If ambitious, even auto-generate HTML from Mobyle XML)


DaReUS-Loop/PepCyclizer example
===============================
  - Banks!
  - Not command-line based, i.e. don't use SnakeMake, use BCSearch routines
  - Need high-level Macro structure: needs deep structure, and automatic transformer
    map/reduce has now been ripped.
  - PyPPP docker image: code is open source, but SVM model is secret

More examples
============
- Port the peptide trajectory editor, use Observable instead of Jupyter.
- Build upon struclib
- Build upon grid editor

Set up a network infrastructure at console
==========================================
Need to choose/combine data-management.txt and seamless-tools.txt,
 and draw inspiration from docs/archive/seamless-services.txt / checksums.txt
Finally, take features from usability-todo.txt, and think of how to regulate:
- Docker image execution (esp Docker transformers)
- Policy of whitelisting/forwarding certain transformer code checksums


Documentation
=============
- Update interoperability document
- Prepare simple demo notebooks
- Prepare some docs (at least stubs)
- Update Github

Missing features
================
issue E2, E3 (TODO: port these to GitHub issues)

Known issues
============
(See issues/ folder. TODO: port these to GitHub issues)
