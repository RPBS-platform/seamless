Get high-level reactors working again.
This has been labeled as feature E2 in the code, where it should be inserted.
This also means that high-level edit pins should be implemented again;
 it must be tested that this does not mess up authority.
Once it works:
- use WIP/merge-reactor as a use case.
- Think of start/stop side effects of reactors
(could be big memory leak otherwise)
