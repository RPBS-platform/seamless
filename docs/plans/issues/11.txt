Stability issues
================

In the context of Redis + job slave (i.e. cloudless), there is a problem with auto_translate.

When a new cell is created, asking it for its value hangs forever, and no Redis buffer entry is created.

This problem disappears with auto_translate=False.


Perhaps related:

When adapting share-pdb to share-pdb-docker in seamless-devel-serve-graph-interactive (no Redis, no jobslave),
 changing the "fix_pdb" transformer to "docker" and setting its docker_image, then setting the "filter_pdb"
 transformer to "docker", then *"filter_pdb"* has a docker_image whereas *"fix_pdb"* has *not*.

This could be the same issue, or related to some inappropriate serialize_cache or deserialize_cache usage

UPDATE: as of March 26, auto_translate (sometimes, partially) silently fails in Jupyter kernels.
For now, disable auto_translate.
