E3. High-level Macro construct around low-level macro; 
  shouldn't be too hard, but connections in and out of the macro-generated context could be tricky.
  => Macro.path(...).connect(...) , Macro.path(...).connect_from(...)
  Wrapping everything in a single Macro with some connections into .share, .mount etc.
   is a good way to get sth working quickly, until the high level works well.

(Has been marked as E3 in the code, in places where the feature should be inserted)
