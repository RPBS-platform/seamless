- Constructors, finish testing
  Test library-containing-another-library
  Make sure constructors work correctly when copying parent contexts
  Test indirect library update system, also with constructors

UPDATE: some progress has been made with stdlib.switch/join .
library-containing-another-library has not yet been tested.
"indirect library update system"? Hasn't that been ripped?

UPDATE: big data branch will cover this.
