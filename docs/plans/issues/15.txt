For tests that are currently semi-automated, it would be nice to 
convert them to automatic tests. This is particularly useful to reproduce 
stability-related issues coming from the usage of IPython/Jupyter.
This requires several things:
- A proper kernel setup that can emulate the terminal. ipython is 
already a terminal, but Jupyter Notebook needs to be emulated 
with console (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_console/issues/207)
- A facility to "record" events. In the simplest form, this is just
the script cut into lines, where each line is an event (as each line
is entered one after another).
More sophisticated: 
    - record the time where every line was received.
    - record external set_buffer/set_checksum events (as would originate
    from mount, share, reactors)
    - record incoming/outgoing communion request events
- A facility to "play" events. 
pexpect can in principle do this, but when controlled by pexpect, 
ipython does not run the asyncio gui in the background. Raise an issue
with ipython?
