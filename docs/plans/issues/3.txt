Pseudo-cyclic graphs
====================

Fix cancellation policy wrt structured cell (now, everything is cancelled,
which prevents expression morphing (i.e. data value will always be fetched)
and makes modified_auth_paths/modified_inchannels useless) 

Canceling of subpaths was never implemented in the way described in the livegraph design document.
Lots of code is commented out in StructuredCellJoin.
This leads to over-eager cancellation. In particular, it is not possible to create a pseudo-cycle,
where structured_cell.a depends on structured_cell.b.
