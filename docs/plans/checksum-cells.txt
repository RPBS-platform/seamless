- Checksum cells
Contain a checksum in hex value.
Can be trivially converted to text, str. Can be re-interpreted from text, str.
All other conversions are based on re-interpretation (see below)
If connected from a non-deep cell, the value is equal to that cell's checksum attribute.
If connected from a deep cell, the value is equal to that cell's deep structure (as dict/list).
Likewise, when connecting from a checksum cell:
- A non-deep cell checks that the checksum is a single checksum, and accepts that as its own checksum
- A deep cell checks that the deep structure is correct, and accepts that deep structure as its own.
Since checksum cells can be bound to macro paths, and deep cells (being structured cells) cannot, this is currently the only way
 to connect deep cells inside a macro to the outside.
