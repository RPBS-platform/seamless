Adapt old plan: execution cells

Execution cells are cells that contain only execution details and do not influence the result.
  Examples: number of CPUs, temp directory where to execute slash in, caching locations
Changes in execution cells do not trigger re-computation, but a reactor
 will receive the new value once something else triggers re-computation.
