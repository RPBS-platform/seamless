What would be needed to port the Seamless high level API to the browser

node["TEMP"] refers to a literal (i.e. Python) construction value. Low-level cells are needed to
  parse this to a serializable value. Right now, the mid-level does this on the first translation pass, then pops the TEMP.
  This is very ugly. mid-level should be configured to invoke remote parsing, and remote parsing should be invokable without
  translation. This way, the translate.py can be disconnected, and the remaining mid-and-high-level routines could run in
  the browser (under Pyodide; Transcrypt is probably less useful since we would want a Python REPL). If *all* of the state
  is in the graph (i.e. Python Context, Cell etc are just thin wrappers), then the graph could be manipulated in parallel
  by JS, e.g. manipulating the position of the node on a visualization canvas).
  Right now this is not exactly the case: there is context._graph but ALSO context._children.
