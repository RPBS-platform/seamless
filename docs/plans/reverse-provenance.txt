Reverse provenance
====================

(aka "re-compute on the fly")

UPDATE: this has been implemented as "fingertipping" (imperative per-cell API)

Imagine the case where a graph has just been loaded. You know all checksums, but not the values.
For now, all values must be stored in an accompanying cache archive.
In the future, make it possible to store just the authoritative values.
When a non-authoritative cell value is requested, and there is a cache miss, 
 travel back the graph and evaluate the transformers to re-compute the result.
This should be enabled/disabled on a by-cell basis (if any cell upstream has it
 disabled, don't do it).
