Deep cells do not work quite the way as in the livegraph document.
In addition, structured cells buffer their auth value (as a deep structure, so not mem-intensive;
anyway, it is (should?) be cleared after join). Together, this leads to a memory leak,
as the buffered auth value deep structure does not incref its checksums.

========

buffer cache references are not reliable, especially with
hash patterns (without, they *seem* to be fine, but some fishy things
happen at the midlevel...)
The double decref warning has been disabled for now...
For production, don't rely on buffer cache, but have Redis as a backup!!
UPDATE: memory freeing can now be disabled completely,
 this should be enabled by default in Jupyter notebooks (UPDATE: is this still true?).
Maybe:
 In the future, drop refcounting scheme, use garbage collection that periodically checks if a checksum is reachable.

UPDATE: memory freeing is DISABLED for now, as CacheMissErrors still occur,
 in particular when changing ctx.receptor in mti-autodock.

UPDATE: database branch has solved this, it seems.
