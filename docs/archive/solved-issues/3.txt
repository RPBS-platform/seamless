Pseudo-cyclic graphs
====================

Fix cancellation policy wrt structured cell (now, everything is cancelled,
which prevents expression morphing (i.e. data value will always be fetched)
and makes modified_auth_paths/modified_inchannels useless) 

Canceling of subpaths was never implemented in the way described in the livegraph design document.
Lots of code is commented out in StructuredCellJoin.
This leads to over-eager cancellation. In particular, it is not possible to create a pseudo-cycle,
where structured_cell.a depends on structured_cell.b.

tests/lowlevel/structured_cell/preliminary.py is not working for that reason.
Same for tests/highlevel/filesystemlike.py 
A more simple pseudo-cycle test should be implemented first

Another over-eager cancellation is that of editpins towards their connected cells

Finally, even in its crippled form (eliminating pseudo-cycles), its has a memory leak:
