gdb debugging:

It is not really possible to unload compiled extension modules in Python.
    Right now, Seamless gets around this by marking every module with a different
    name ("seamless-" + checksum). Still, the symbols in those modules point to
     the same source files, which may have changed on disk.
    I found that if multiple versions of the same module/file greatly confuses
     gdb, so that breakpoints no longer work.
    UPDATE: after some fiddling, it seems to work now.
