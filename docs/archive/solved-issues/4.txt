Conversion from structured cell to binary cell goes wrong
The issue was partially fixed in commit 7c46d9c5a065397c4c014528c2eae8416dd6ef20.
However, tests/highlink-cpp still needs to have a line disabled, in order to work.

UPDATE: binary cells store their buffer wrong.
The Numpy header part is lost, only the bytes are kept!
