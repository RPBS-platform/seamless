TODO: Following the presentation:
Store and load computation graphs:
X Tests to "color" the graph (use Redis to fill in values)
X Tests for remote deployment of jobs
X Test for remote execution of a graph
X Get Bash transformer working again
- Docker transformer
- Conversions for Galaxy, Mobyle, SnakeMake
- Simple protein-based example
- Create example
- Update interoperability document

Improvements: [two months fulltime of implementation]
Bugs: missing code paths, especially type conversion (also int/float/... cells) [a few days]
Bugs: interaction between Seamless features (e.g. high-level reactors), smoother API [continuous]
Interaction with rest of the world (bring back polyglot, add R) [a few days]
    => Compiled language without a compiler
Easier to work with:
- Automatic generation of web form GUIs [a day for initial proof-of-principle]
- Graph GUI [a day for initial proof-of-principle]
- Libraries/subcontexts/constructors [a few days]
- Logging error messages, cache misses, network traffic, progress bars [one week for a first implementation ]
- Job/cache control (canceling, job database, address cache memory leaks) [up to 2 weeks for a prototype]
- Better control of execution details (execution options, non-deterministic input pins, ephemeral cells, reactor start/stop side effects) [one week for initial implementation]
- Shells, or workers-as-Jupyter-kernels [a few days]
Big Data: deep cells [a few days], full streams (reduction, multi-inputs) [a few days]
Slash [a few days for reintegration]
GPU support: block cells [a week]

Long-term features:
Special constructs
Latency reduction: Stream-stream, GPU-GPU
Full-featured Silk
Git integration (with modularity)
Debugger integration
All the very-long-term stuff: DSL commands, Idris, plugin-socket
